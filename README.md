# VectorsOnSphere
display unit vectors projected onto a sphere - with rotation - via a slider

Some number of random 3D unit vectors are created (editable), and as each generation is iterated, the vectors are moved away from its nearest neighbors, eventually spreading to an even angular distance from its neighbors. 

Minimum angle difference is displayed in title bar.

Uses Java 14, but I think it will run in Java 8 -- at least it did in the one graphics trouble shooting test I did.
